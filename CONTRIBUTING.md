# Contributing to muharrir

Thank you for considering a contribution! This document covers the development
workflow, coding standards, and review process.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MacCracken/muharrir.git
cd muharrir

# Ensure you have the correct toolchain (see rust-toolchain.toml)
rustup show

# Run the full local CI suite
make check
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork and branch** — create a feature branch from `main`.
2. **Keep commits focused** — one logical change per commit.
3. **Write tests** — new features require tests; bug fixes require a regression
   test.
4. **Run CI locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   make check        # fmt + clippy + test + audit
   ```
5. **Open a PR** against `main` with a clear description of the change.
6. **Address review feedback** — maintainers may request changes before merging.

## Code Style

- Follow `rustfmt` defaults (enforced by CI).
- Zero clippy warnings (`cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings`).
- Public API items must have doc comments.
- Use `#[inline]` on small, hot-path functions.
- Use `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums.
- Use `#[must_use]` on pure functions and constructors.
- Prefer `write!` over `format!`, `Cow` over clone.
- Feature-gate optional dependencies.

## Testing Requirements

- All public API changes must include unit tests.
- Integration tests go in `tests/`.
- Benchmarks go in `benches/` and should be run before/after performance-sensitive
  changes.
- Target: maintain or improve code coverage on every PR.

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test --all-features

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```
